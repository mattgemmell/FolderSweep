FolderSweeper 1.0

This project implements a fast and easy way of sweeping over a folder, optionally looking at all subfolders and/or file contents.

The FolderSweeper class can probably be lifted as-is from this project and used in your project; in fact, it's based on production code for at least one shipping application. It has, however, been modified to be more generally applicable.

We've tried to explain what is going inside, and why it's done that way. Some other peripheral things are also explained as we feel that this will also be useful to less-experienced Cocoa programmers.

Eventually this may be merged into a private project for a fuller-featured alternative to NSFileManager/NSWorkspace, meaning that there'll be a class representing a generic file system object. Stay tuned.
